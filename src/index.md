# Introduction

[Coreum](https://coreum.com) is a third-generation, layer one blockcahin built atop the Cosmos SDK. The ecosystem natively supports the issueance and minting of tokens, a Decentralised Exchange (DEX) to enable trading these tokens, and an interoperability bridge to foreign chains such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, and the XRP Ledger.

Moreover, Coreum is fast, low cost, and environmentally friendly. An established usecase for a network like Coreum is the [Sologenic Ecosystem](https://sologenic.com), which currently resides on the XRP Ledger.

The native token for Coreum is $CORE, which is used for fees, rewards, and intermediary-asset market making in the DEX using a synthetic orderbook.

## Decentralised Exchange (DEX)

The DEX is native to the blockchain, enabling low-fee, secure, and fast trading activities. The DEX supports the trading of $CORE, as well as any issued assets found on Coreum. Moreover, the market is able to create trading pairs between any two assets, allowing for limitless trading opportunities.

## Bridges

The system of bridges creates gateways which allow for foreign assets from other blockchains to interoperate with, and be wrapepd within Coreum.
