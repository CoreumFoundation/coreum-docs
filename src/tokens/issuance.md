# Token Issuance

Token issuance is the creation of non-native tokens on a blockchain. Generally speaking, the value of tokens are associated with the value of some asset. This asset may either be representative of services on the blockchain itself, or represetnative of assets that are foreign to the blockchain. For instance, an application on the blockchain may issue tokens to represent interactions with that application. Alternatively, non-blockchain assets such as stocks and commodities may be represented on the blockchain as issued tokens, where the quanities of tokens matched with quantities of the real world asset.
